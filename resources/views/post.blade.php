    <p>Laravel includes Eloquent, an object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes
        it enjoyable to interact with your database. When using Eloquent, each database table 
        has a corresponding  that is used to interact with that table. In addition to retrieving
         records from the database table, Eloquent models allow you to insert, update, and delete 
        records from the table as well
